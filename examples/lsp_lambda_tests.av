# Lambda expression tests
# Tests that lambda parameters are correctly tracked

# Single parameter lambda
let double = \x x * 2 in
let result1 = double 5 in

# Multi-parameter lambda
let add = \x \y x + y in
let result2 = add 5 3 in

# Lambda with complex body
let complex = \x (x * 2) + (x - 1) in
let result3 = complex 10 in

# Lambda shadowing outer variable
let x = 10 in
let shadow = \x x * 2 in

# Nested lambdas
let nested = \x \y \z (x + y) * z in

# Lambda in list operations
let nums = [1, 2, 3] in
let squared = map (\x x * x) nums in

# All tests passed if no LSP errors reported
