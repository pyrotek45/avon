# Type mismatch tests - these should all produce errors
# Uncomment each test to verify error detection

# String + Number should error (if strings aren't implicitly converted)
# let error1 = "hello" + 5 in

# Number > String should error
# let error2 = 5 > "3" in

# List operation on non-list should error
# let error3 = head 5 in

# Dict.field on non-dict should error
# let error4 = "string".field in

# Boolean operator on number should error
# let error5 = 5 and 3 in

# Filter with non-function should error
# let error6 = filter 5 [1,2,3] in

# All tests passed if no LSP errors reported
