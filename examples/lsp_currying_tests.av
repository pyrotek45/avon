# Currying and partial application tests
# Tests that builtin functions support currying

# Partial application of map
let map_double = map (\x x * 2) in
let result1 = map_double [1, 2, 3] in

# Partial application of filter
let filter_positive = filter (\x x > 0) in
let result2 = filter_positive [-1, 2, -3, 4] in

# Partial application of fold
let sum_fold = fold (\a \b a + b) 0 in
let result3 = sum_fold [1, 2, 3] in

# Chained partial application
let replace_a = replace "hello" "l" in
let result4 = replace_a "L" in

# Partial application with pipes
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in
let result5 = nums -> filter (\x x > 2) -> map (\x x * 2) in

# All tests passed if no LSP errors reported
